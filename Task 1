-- Create table
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_name VARCHAR(50),
    balance DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (1, 'Alice', 1000.00);
INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 500.00);

-- Begin the transaction
BEGIN;

-- Step 1: Deduct 500 from account 1 (Alice)
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 500.00
WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Create a SAVEPOINT after deduction
SAVEPOINT after_deduction;

-- Step 2: Try to credit account 2 (which does not exist, will fail)
-- This step is supposed to fail (simulate error)
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 500.00
WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Step 3: Rollback to SAVEPOINT (undo failed step only)
ROLLBACK TO after_deduction;

-- Step 4: Correct credit â€” credit account 3 (Charlie) instead
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 500.00
WHERE account_id = 3;

-- Step 5: Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
